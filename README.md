# Overview

This project implements a simple autocomplete feature that provides up to 4 suggestions based on the input string provided by the user. The suggestions are derived from a predefined list of keywords and are returned in alphabetical order. The project is implemented in Java and follows an object-oriented approach.


## Features

Autocomplete Suggestions: Provides up to 4 suggestions for a given input string.

Alphabetical Sorting: Results are always sorted alphabetically.

Case Insensitivity: Suggestions are generated regardless of the input's case.

Efficient Searching: Optimized for handling moderately sized keyword lists.


## Technologies Used

Java: Primary programming language for implementation.

JUnit: For testing the functionality.


## Problem Statement

Implement an autocomplete feature for the provided keyword list.

Ensure results are sorted alphabetically.

Handle case-insensitive input.


## Keywords
